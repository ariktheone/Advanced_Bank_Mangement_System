# Banking Management Application

## Overview
This is a Java Swing-based banking management application designed to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for banking operations. It prioritizes security, ease of use, and offers multiple functionalities suitable for students and small-scale banking operations.

## Problem Statement and Solution
Existing banking management applications often demand extensive knowledge of application development, making them inaccessible to individuals without specialized skills. This project resolves this challenge by leveraging Java Swing, an extension of the Java language, to create a user-friendly banking management application without the complexity of app development.

## Unique Features
